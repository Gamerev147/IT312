SNHU - Software Development w/ C++ .NET

This course teaches students how to design, implement and test applications in the C++ programming language.  Topics include C++ data types, operators, 
functions, classes and inheritance.  The course introduces students to issues associated with developing real-world applications by presenting several case 
studies. The concepts of object-oriented design and programming are covered.

The final project for this course was a text-based dice game. I chose to create the dice game "Left Right Center."
